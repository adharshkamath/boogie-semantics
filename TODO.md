This is the plan for transitioning to the Pyk/KSummarize like architecture.

1.  Get test/operational/control-flow passing
2.  Refresh the build system
3.  Create pyk runner for collatting test results
4.  Get test/operational/ passing
5.  Get loop-free quant-free symbolic test passing
6.  Get looping   quant-free symbolic test passing (with manual infereence)
?.  Get quantifiers working via pyk
?.  Get inference working.
